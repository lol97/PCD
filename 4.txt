(a) Sample microscopy and (b) autofluorescent images of the same longitudinal section of cooked rice kernel stuck to a piece of adhesive tape. A simple image-processing algorithm for inverting the negative image and contrast enhancement to the autofluorescent image is carried out for better observation of visualized cell distributions. The section thickness is 20µm; the magnification bar is 1mm. 
Magnifications of (a) the fringe and (b) the central area of the autofluorescent image in Figure 16.7. The magnification bar is 100µm.
Images of microscopy for the histological sections of the compressed rice sample and their autofluorescent images focused in the void area. The compression ratios were 30% (a, d), 50% (b, e), 70% (c, f). These are perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. The magnification bar for the microscopy images is 1mm, and for the autoflurescence images is 100µm.
