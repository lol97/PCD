The use of computer vision technology for raw and cooked rice quality evaluation, and results from this technique, have been summarized in this chapter, though there may be more related research such as near-infrared spectroscopic imaging and ultra-weak photon-emission imaging. Because computer vision technology is still progressing along with the development of hardware and software, lots of unidentified characteristics will be revealed. Such computerized techniques for rice quality evaluation should be followed not only by “real imaging techniques” but also by “virtual visualization techniques”–forexample, hardness distribution with textural mechanics by parametric modeling.
